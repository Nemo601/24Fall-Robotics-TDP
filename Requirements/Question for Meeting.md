### 1 Technical Problems:
1. Will our modeling of the robot team be applied 100% to the hardware deployment in the second phase?
2. Considering that there is a NAO6 robot modeling method applied to webots software on Github, I would like to ask whether our initial modeling work, including robot physical modeling and behavior modeling, is recommended to be done with MATLAB or other software?
3. The PPT for our first class said “the team have to develop test schedules in order to request access to the hardware from the supervisor”. What “test schedules” means?
4. Where are all the simulation steps in "Design Schedule & Review implemented"?
5. Do we need to model the entire system from zero, which means we need to design the math part, and does this process need to be reflected in the final report?

### 2 Team Management
1. Who will take meeting minutes of our team?
2. How the "Technical progress and Team work" will be assessed in the meeting, will it be marked?
3. How to keep Time Allocation Records (TARs) ?
4. group capabilities, project plan, time schedule and cost estimate at first meeting with your supervisor !!!
